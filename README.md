## Lab 1: Machine Learning for Government and Policy

**Date: 09.09.2022**

The first lab assesses the group's Python level via a quiz, which we then answer together. We also set up Github for everybody. Problem Set 0 was sent to everyone via a link in moodle.

[Lab exercises](https://github.com/Hertie-School-Machine-Learning-F2022/Class_Lab_01)

**Problem Set 0:** Hello World to be pushed into individual repos, link sent via Moodle. <br/><br/>

## Lab 2: Ethical ML

**Date: 16.09.2022**

Overview of loops in python. Together, we will go over the machine learning pipeline in broad terms using the boston_housing data. Examine boston_housing data, identify the year that it’s from, identify what the variables are, and talk about how that introduces bias in the model.

**Problem Set 1 was moved to next week** For more information please refer to the Moodle announcement.

## Lab 3: End-to-End Machine Learning Project

**Date: 23.09.2022**

Continue with the Sci-kit learn intro. Talk about train and test sets, using Iris plants dataset. 

[Lab exercises](https://github.com/Hertie-School-Machine-Learning-F2022/Class_lab_03)

**Problem Set 1:** 7 questions from what we went through in class with a new data set. <br/><br/>

## Lab 4: Machine Learning Landscape

**Date: 30.09.2022**

Pre-processing steps for numerical data (MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler) and categorical data (one-hot encoding). Begin a pipeline with both numerical and categorical data and apply a logistic regression (abalone datset).

[Lab exercises](https://github.com/Hertie-School-Machine-Learning-F2022/Class_lab_04)

**Problem Set 2:** 10 questions that explore the differences between preprocessing steps, and the application of a linear regression pipeline that students have to set up. <br/><br/>

# **No lab on 07.10.2022**<br/><br/>

## Lab 5: Linear Regression

**Date: 14.10.2022**

**This lab session will be held online, check moodle announcements for zoom links**

Linear regression problem formulation. Set up a pipeline for Simple and Multivariate linear regression; Introduce interactions and dummy variables into the model. Linear Regression metric scores discussed.

## Lab 6: Classification

**Date: 21.10.2022**

Logistic Regression for binary classification problems, with visulization to understand probability distributions and threshold for labels using the Penguin data set limited to two species. Additioanlly, metrics for classification problems are reviewed, focusing on imbalanced dataset, analyzing precision-recall plots and ROC Curve, using the blood donation dataset.

**Problem Set 3: will be distributed after class** <br/><br/>

## Lab 7: Resampling and regularisation

**Date: 04.11.2022**

Explore underfitting and overfitting. Start with a decission tree regressor to observe overfitting, then use resampling strategies as training and testing, and CV to explor train error and test error on California Housing Dataset. Then understand regularization methods for decision tree using max depth and validation curve; Understand a different method, lasso for regression, using alpha to understand what regularization does, using advertising data set.

## Lab 8: Tree-based Methods

**Date: 11.11.2022**

Understand how Decision Trees for classification and regression work, using the penguin dataset. Explore the different hyperparameters that can be tuned for a Decision Tree, and how that affects tree symetry. Then, a Random Forest example will be presented. Every part of the lab will have a excercise that has to be done in teams of 2 or 3. This excercises have to be finished after class.

[Lab exercises](https://github.com/Hertie-School-Machine-Learning-F2022/Class_Lab_08)

**Problem Set 4:**  <br/>Submit the lab's excercises on MOODLE with the full descriptions and plots asked for in the script. One per team due on 17.11.2022 <br/>

## Lab 9: Deep Learning

**Date: 18.11.2022**

A simple Neural Networks from scratch to understand forward pass, activation function and gradient descent for Neural Networks for a binary classification problem. 

[Lab exercises](https://github.com/Hertie-School-Machine-Learning-F2022/Class_Lab_09/blob/main/README.md) <br/><br/>

## Lab 10: Unsupervised Learning

**Date: 25.11.2022**

Understand the underlying implementation of PCA and K-means Clustering. Go over an example of how to integrate PCA into a Logistic Regression Pipeline, and how K-means can differ depending on the initialization.

**Problem Set 5:**  <br/>https://github.com/Hertie-School-Machine-Learning-F2022/Problem_Set_05<br/>

## Lab 11: Multiple Testing

**Date: 02.12.2022**

Review what a p-values is, an overview of what FDR is, and examine what type 1 errors in ML mean, and how to approach them with ROC and DET curves.
