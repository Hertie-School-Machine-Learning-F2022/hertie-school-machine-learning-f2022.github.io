## Lab 1: Machine Learning for Government and Policy

**Date: 09.09.2022**

The first lab assesses the group's Python level via a quiz, which we then answer together. We also set up Github for everybody. Problem Set 0 was sent to everyone via a link in moodle.

**Problem Set 0:** Hello World to be pushed into individual repos, link sent via Moodle. <br/><br/>

## Lab 2: Ethical ML

**Date: 16.09.2022**

Overview of loops in python. Together, we will go over the machine learning pipeline in broad terms using the boston_housing data. Examine boston_housing data, identify the year that it’s from, identify what the variables are, and talk about how that introduces bias in the model.

**Problem Set 1 was moved to next week** For more information please refer to the Moodle announcement.

## Lab 3: End-to-End Machine Learning Project

**Date: 23.09.2022**

Continue with the Sci-kit learn intro. Talk about train and test sets, using Iris plants dataset. 

[Lab exercises](https://github.com/Hertie-School-Machine-Learning-F2022/Class_lab_03)

**Problem Set 1:** 7 questions from what we went through in class with a new data set. <br/><br/>

## Lab 4: Machine Learning Landscape

**Date: 30.09.2022**

Pre-processing steps for numerical data (MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler) and categorical data (ordinal encoding, one-hot encoding). Begin a pipeline with both numerical and categorical data and apply a logistic regression (Melbourn Housing datset).

[Lab exercises]()

**Problem Set 2:** 7 questions from the logistic regression pipeline that students have to finish setting up, that encompasses pre-processing for numerical and categorical, order of the pipeline and results. <br/><br/>

**No lab on 07.10.2022**<br/><br/>

## Lab 5: Linear Regression

**Date: 14.10.2022**

Linear regression problem formulation (Pinguin dataset). Set up a pipeline for Multivariate linear regression; fit and predict. Set up a pipeline for Polynomial linear regression; fit and predict. Discuss overfitting and underfitting; Talk about the bias-variance trade-off.
